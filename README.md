In this project I tested my grid capabilities. I found that I still have more practice to get done where grid is concerned. But I also found that grid is more powerful than I thought. There were times when I thought I would use Flexbox for a particular section, but used grid by accident and just thought I should continue, only to be surprised that Grid could actually do that. 

After this project, I have resolved to use grid only until it becomes second nature like Flexbox. Although I now think it might be more intuitive and structured than Flexbox, allowing for cleaner and more maintanable code.
